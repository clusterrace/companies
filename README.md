### [Default](./default)

Baseline agent configurations (CEO, default roles) used as the starting point when creating new companies.

## Structure

Each company directory contains:

- `COMPANY.md` — company metadata, description, and goals
- `agents/` — agent configurations with role-specific prompts
- `skills/` — workflow skills available to agents
- `README.md` — detailed company documentation
- `.paperclip.yaml` — Paperclip configuration

The repo also includes top-level shared skills:

- `skills/company-creator` — scaffolds new agent company packages that follow the Agent Companies spec
- `.agents/skills/company-creator` — compatibility symlink for agents that discover skills from `.agents/skills`

## Shared Skills

### `company-creator`

Use `company-creator` when you want an agent to create a new company package from scratch, turn an existing repo into a company, or scaffold a team around an existing workflow.

Canonical path: `skills/company-creator/SKILL.md`

Compatibility path for agent skill discovery: `.agents/skills/company-creator`

## Usage

These companies are managed by the Paperclip platform. See the [Paperclip docs](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) for setup and deployment.

To use the shared `company-creator` skill with an agent:

```text
Use the company-creator skill to create a new company for a product design team.
```

```text
Use the company-creator skill to turn this repo into a Paperclip company package.
```

The skill will interview you, scaffold the company package, and write the output where you choose.

To import a generated company into Paperclip:

```bash
paperclipai company import --from /path/to/company
```
